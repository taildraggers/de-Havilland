# de Havilland

Daily aggregator of de Havilland aircraft classified listings (Beaver, Otter,
Chipmunk, Moth, etc.) from [Barnstormers.com](https://www.barnstormers.com),
published as a static page (`docs/index.html`) meant to be embedded via
`<iframe>` on taildraggers.com.

Controller.com was evaluated (in the companion [Aeronca](https://github.com/taildraggers/aeronca)
repo) and dropped: its search results are only reachable through an internal
client-side widget (not a plain URL), which a headless browser can't drive
reliably for an unattended daily job.

Note: in the companion [Aviat](https://github.com/taildraggers/aviat) repo,
Barnstormers' single-manufacturer category page (their "Aviat Aircraft" hub)
turned out to include unrelated aircraft mixed in with no distinguishing HTML
markup. The same could happen here. This repo currently publishes everything
found in the de Havilland category unfiltered; if testing shows off-brand
listings leaking in, a title allowlist (matching the approach used in the
Aviat repo) should be added to `scraper/barnstormers.py`.

## How it works

- `scraper/barnstormers.py` searches Barnstormers.com's de Havilland category for
  listings, follows pagination, then visits each listing's detail page to pull
  out the price, location, and posted date (falling back to regex heuristics
  over the visible text since the site doesn't expose structured data). The
  title is derived from the listing URL's own SEO slug, since every detail page
  shares one generic `<title>`/`<h1>`.
- `main.py` runs the scraper, de-duplicates results, and renders them into
  `docs/index.html` titled **"Other de Havilland Ads on the Web"**, with
  one row per listing: Title (linked to the original ad), Price, Location,
  Date Posted, and Site Posted On. Links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and
  the page sets a `no-referrer` meta policy, so Barnstormers never sees that
  the click came from taildraggers.com.
- `.github/workflows/daily-scrape.yml` runs the whole thing once a day (13:00 UTC),
  commits the regenerated `docs/index.html` if it changed, and can also be triggered
  manually from the Actions tab (`workflow_dispatch`).

## One-time setup: enable GitHub Pages

This repo publishes `docs/index.html` as a plain static file — GitHub Pages just needs
to be pointed at it once:

1. Go to **Settings → Pages** in this repository.
2. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Branch: `main`, folder: `/docs`. Save.
4. GitHub will publish the page at `https://taildraggers.github.io/de-havilland/`
   (may take a minute or two the first time).

Also check **Settings → Actions → General**:
- **Actions permissions**: "Allow all actions and reusable workflows".
- **Workflow permissions**: "Read and write permissions" (needed so the daily
  job can commit the regenerated page back to the repo).

## Embedding on taildraggers.com

```html
<iframe
  src="https://taildraggers.github.io/de-havilland/"
  title="Other de Havilland Ads on the Web"
  style="width: 100%; height: 800px; border: 0;"
  loading="lazy">
</iframe>
```

## Running locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install --with-deps chromium
python main.py
```

This writes/overwrites `docs/index.html`.

## Notes

- If Barnstormers changes its markup or is briefly unreachable, the run logs will
  show a `[warn]`/`[error]` line pointing at what broke rather than failing silently.
- The scraper identifies itself with a browser-like `User-Agent` and adds a short
  delay between requests to be polite to the site.
- Only one Barnstormers category is currently configured
  (`category-17990-de-Havilland.html`). If listings turn out to be split across
  additional categories, add more URLs to `CATEGORY_URLS` in
  `scraper/barnstormers.py`.
